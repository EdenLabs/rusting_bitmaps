# Rusting Bitmaps
Rusting Bitmaps is a native Rust port of [Roaring Bitmaps](https://roaringbitmap.org/) based on CRoaring.

# Differences
Rusting Bitmaps is a loose port of CRoaring with a few differences
 - An idiomatic and safe Rust API
 - Additional optimizations (particularly around inplace operations)
 - Custom allocator support

# Future Ideas
 - [ ] See about implementing an inverted array for dense sets
 - [ ] Implement tests
