//! Rusting Bitmaps is a loose port of CRoaring with a few differences
//!
//! - An idiomatic and safe Rust API
//! - Additional optimizations (particularly around inplace operations)
//! - Custom allocator support
//! - Copy-on-Write is unsupported

// TODO: Inline trivial fns
// TODO: Reduce unsafe code usage without impacting performance much

/// Wrapper for the `unlikely` intrinsic to mark a branch as 
/// unlikely to be taken.
/// 
/// # Remarks
/// The operation is fundamentally safe however it's marked 
/// as unsafe due to being an intrinsic.
