//! Rusting Bitmaps is a loose port of CRoaring with a few differences
//!
//! - An idiomatic and safe Rust API
//! - Additional optimizations (particularly around inplace operations)
//! - Custom allocator support
//! - Copy-on-Write is unsupported

// TODO: Inline trivial fns
// TODO: Reduce unsafe code usage without impacting performance much
// TODO: Ensure ranges aren't cutoff
// TODO: Run through and change any operations on intermediate containers to be inplace to reduce memory churn
